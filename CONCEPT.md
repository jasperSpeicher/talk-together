# Talk Together - AI Chatbot SMS Platform

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge**: Most AI chatbot solutions are limited to single-user interactions or require specific apps/platforms, making them inaccessible for multi-user scenarios via SMS.

**Our Solution**: A lightweight SaaS platform that connects phone numbers to AI chatbots, enabling multiple people to interact with AI agents from any SMS-enabled device without requiring apps or accounts.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Multi-User AI Conversations**: Enable multiple people to talk to the same AI agent via SMS
- **Universal Accessibility**: Works with any SMS-enabled device (no app required)
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal setup, instant deployment
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use model for small to enterprise customers

## Target Use Cases

1. **Teenage Friend Groups**: Teens sharing AI conversations and experiences
2. **Party/Event Coordination**: Drunk people asking random questions to AI
3. **Family Groups**: Families sharing AI conversations and memories
4. **Community Hangouts**: Neighborhood or community AI helpers


## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Twilio Integration**
   - Webhook endpoints for incoming SMS
   - Outbound SMS via Twilio API
   - Phone number provisioned through Twilio

2. **AI Vendor Selection**
   - Multi-provider AI service integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
   - User-configurable AI service selection
   - Simple API routing to selected vendor

3. **Smart Routing**
   - Store AI vendor preference per phone number
   - Allow the group creator (admin) to switch vendors via SMS commands
   - Route messages to user's currently selected AI vendor

4. **Account Management**
   - Basic account creation and setup
   - SMS-based configuration and support
   - Minimal web interface for account management

5. **Minimal Storage**
   - Phone number → AI vendor mapping
   - User's current AI vendor preference
   - No conversation history or analytics

### Data Flow

```
SMS → Twilio → Our API → AI Processing → Response → SMS → User
```
