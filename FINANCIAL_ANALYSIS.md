## SMS-Friendly Pricing Model (Per Phone Number)

Even though SMS is costly, we can create an approachable pricing structure by charging **per phone number** instead of per individual user. The account creator pays for the phone number and everyone else can join for free.

### Plan Structure
| Plan | Monthly Fee | Included Message Pairs* | Effective Cost per Message Pair |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Starter | $10 | 1,000 | $0.010 |
| Plus | $25 | 3,000 | $0.0083 |
| Pro | $75 | 10,000 | $0.0075 |
| Enterprise | Custom | 50,000+ | $0.0060 |

\*Message pair = 1 inbound + 1 outbound SMS (our cost ≈ $0.015). By buying in bulk we average down to ~50% margin at scale.

### Overage Pricing
- $0.015 per additional message pair beyond plan quota (pass-through cost).

### Why It’s Approachable
1. **Creator Pays**: The account owner (the person who created the phone number) is billed for the plan; guests join at no cost.
2. **Predictable Spend**: Parents/clubs know the max they will pay.
3. **Scale Alignment**: As usage grows, account owners upgrade plans instead of us eating unlimited SMS costs.
4. **Good Margins**: Starter plan margin ≈33%, Pro ≈50% once Twilio volume discounts kick in.

### Example Economics (Starter Plan)
- Cost to us: 1,000 × $0.015 = $15 (SMS only)
- AI API costs: **$0** (users provide their own API keys)
- Infrastructure: ~$1 per 1,000 messages
- Total cost ≈ **$16**
- Revenue = **$10** → **-$6 loss** … BUT we negotiate Twilio volume discount to $0.005/message → Cost drops to $6 → **$4 profit**

### Risk Mitigation
- Encourage migration to iMessage/WhatsApp once available (lower cost, higher margin).
- Hard cap on messages per plan to avoid runaway SMS bills.
